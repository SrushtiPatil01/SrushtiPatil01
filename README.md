# Hi, I’m Srushti Patil 👋

Backend Software Engineer (Ex-Accenture) with 2+ years of experience building **production-grade distributed systems**, **cloud data pipelines**, and **GenAI-powered applications**.  
Currently pursuing MS @ Northeastern University (’26). Seeking **Full-Time Backend/SDE roles starting May 2026**.

---

## What I Do
- Design and build **Java / Spring Boot microservices** with a focus on reliability, security, and performance
- Own systems end-to-end: **design → implementation → CI/CD → cloud deployment → production support**
- Build **data-intensive workflows** using Snowflake, Kafka, and PostgreSQL
- Apply **Generative AI (RAG, agentic workflows)** to real production problems with measurable impact

---

## Core Technical Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Go, Python, REST APIs, OAuth2 / Spring Security  
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform  
- **Data & Streaming:** Snowflake, Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **GenAI:** LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI APIs, Vector Search, CrewAI  
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch  
- **Other:** React, Linux, Maven, Gradle

---

## How I Work
- I care about **correctness under failure**, not just happy paths
- I design with **operability in mind**: metrics, logs, health checks
- I think in terms of **tradeoffs**: latency vs cost, simplicity vs flexibility
- I value clean abstractions and incremental delivery in production systems
